      I've worked with professional cameramen who've had years of experience in
      the industry, and seen editors reworking footage with astonishing speed
      and creativity. I am not them, but experience feeds into results more
      quickly then ever thanks to the availability of kit.
      <p>
        I have a flexible system, with a range of prime lenses and a zoom, I'm
        able to set down my tripod and concentrate on making each frame
        beautiful or go handheld and cover any footage needed with maximum
        efficiency.

        When editing, I like to make sure things are both clear and concise. I
        work well alone with a simple brief or editing creatively, but generally
        bouncing options off another person is the fastest way to edit.
      </p>
      I'm based in the North-West, but my kit travels very easily, not
      necessarily just by car. Please have a look through some of the examples
      on the site, and if you're looking to have anything done, please get in
      touch.
