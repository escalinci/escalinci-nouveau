      If you need more effective communication across your organisation, or have
      parts of your workforce who don't feel listened to or valued, video can be

      engaging way and putting a face to them through a recording is the next
      best thing to sitting down with every employee and speaking to them
      personally. Where I can give a hand is making sure those on screen,
      wherever they come from in the organisation, are coming across in the best
      way, and to be succinct in editing while adding a little extra!

      the sponsors of the project across the Trust's different hospitals, both
      demonstrating their enthusiasm and the connection across the whole Trust.
