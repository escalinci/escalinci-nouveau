        I&#39;ve worked as a Runner in many capacities; ringing up audiences and
        helping out with research in the office, looking after contributors on
        locations, or assisting the crew by booming or managing tapes.

        This has given me an inside track on many different formats, but also
        the habit of never making assumptions or being afraid to ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my mind, the ideal runner is flexible, and takes their cue from how
        the team works, then deriving from that how they can best support them.

        I have experience of live tv, mainly from working in shopping
        television, and on Mentorn&#39;s the big questions, a studio debate
        show. However it is often before going live, or shooting to edit later,
        where the runner is relied upon more.

        I’m based in the North West, but it’s also easy for me to work in
        London. I have a full, clean UK driving license and my car’s insured for
        business use.

        I can shoot great gvs and extra actuality, as well as zipping around
        doing whatever&#39;s needed.
