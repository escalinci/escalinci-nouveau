        I have worked on location as a camera trainee, and am hopeful to move up
        to working as a clapper/loader.

        My first on-set experience was working on Waterloo Road, shadowing the
        camera team. More recently, I worked on Stella Series 1, and ITV&#39;s
        Jambusters.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result I can get to grips with a team very quickly. I&#39;m well
        versed in the duties of a trainee, and the roles of the rest of the
        team, as well as set etiquette and the rest, but I also find the most
        productions work slightly differently, so I&#39;m also quite flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was very appreciative to get to the interview stage for the skillset
        camera trainee placement scheme. This was both encouraging and daunting.
        I&#39;m based in the North West and London, if you&#39;d like to test me
        out, My contacts are at the bottom left of the page.
