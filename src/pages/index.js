      Hello there. I'm Ethan Duffy, if you click on the video above, you can
      have a look at some clips from videos I've produced. It's quite a variety,
      so if you're interested in something specific, hopefully the different
      categories on this site have something relevant for you. I also work as a
      runner, having a wide range of experience on a lot of good shows, and I've
      been part of the camera team on some scripted shows.{' '}
